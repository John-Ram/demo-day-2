     <p>Hi, I'm Matthew! I am originally from a small town in Wisconsin, the population is only around 5,000. I never knew what I wanted to do in highschool so I decided to enlist in the U.S Navy. The Navy took me around the world and I got to meet some awesome people. My favorite duty station was an island below India called Diego Garcia.</p>
